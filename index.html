<h1>ISMS Scope</h1>

<h2>Scope-</h2>
<p>
This ISMS scope covers the following components within my home network and study environment.
The ISMS covers the normal operation, access control, data storage, synchronization and account
security of the defined environment. The purpose of defining this scope is to clearly identify
what systems, devices, and information assets are included and protected under the ISMS.
</p>

<p>
The scope is limited to systems and services that I personally own, use, and control.
Anything outside this control is excluded and justified in the exclusions section.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Infrastructure- DNA router, Wi-Fi network</li>
  <li>
    Devices- HP windows laptop (primary device for coursework, assignments and technical exercises),
    iPhone 13 (used for cloud access and MFA), Kindle (used for reading coursework sometimes)
  </li>
  <li>
    Information Assets- Course materials, personal notes, repositories and all other associated
    accounts, credential and MFA
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
These assets are required to support my studies and coursework. The security of these assets is
important to ensure availability of study materials, protection of personal data, and secure
access to cloud-based services.
</p>

<h2>Exclusions</h2>
<h3>Out of scope</h3>

<p>
The following items are excluded from the ISMS scope because they are not used for coursework,
or they are not under my ownership or control.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nintendo switch (used for gaming mainly)</li>
  <li>Housemate’s devices are outside my ownership and control</li>
  <li>Infrastructure of the internet side of the ISP router cannot be controlled by me</li>
</ul>

<p>
Risks related to these excluded assets are accepted, as security controls cannot reasonably be
applied to them within this ISMS.
</p>

<h2>Key interfaces</h2>

<p>
Key interfaces describe how the in-scope systems interact with external systems and services.
These interfaces represent important security boundaries.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cloud services- GitHub, iCloud, OneDrive</li>
  <li>Remote access- VPN, SSH</li>
  <li>External boundary- Router connecting home network to internet</li>
  <li>Suppliers- ISP (DNA), device vendors and cloud service providers</li>
</ul>

<p>
Access to cloud services is performed over the internet using authenticated user accounts.
Remote access technologies such as VPN and SSH are used when required for coursework or
technical exercises.
</p>

<h2>Network and interface diagram</h2>

<p>
The home network consists of a DNA router that provides a connection between the internal
home network and the internet. The HP laptop, iPhone, and Kindle connect to the router using
the Wi-Fi network. Cloud services such as GitHub, iCloud, and OneDrive are accessed through
the internet connection provided by the router.
</p>

<h2>Evidences</h2>

<p>
The following evidence can be provided to demonstrate the existence and operation of the
in-scope assets and security controls.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Screenshot of DNA router configuration and connected devices</li>
  <li>GitHub profile or repository link</li>
  <li>iCloud and OneDrive account security and MFA settings</li>
  <li>Device lists from Apple ID and google accounts</li>
  <li>System information from laptop</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interested parties and ISO 27001 Alignement</h2>

<p>
Interested parties are individuals or organizations that have an interest in the security of
the home network and study environment. Their needs and expectations are considered as part
of the ISMS.

<p>
As the ISMS owner, I am responsible for maintaining the security of the in-scope assets,
accepting residual risks, and ensuring that the ISMS remains suitable for my study environment.
